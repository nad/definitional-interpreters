-- Definitional interpreters can model systems with bounded space
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- In "Reasoning on Divergent Computations with Coaxioms" Ancona,
-- Dagnino and Zucca write the following:
--
--   "To assess the applicability and generality of our approach much
--   work is still needed. We are currently considering to apply
--   coaxioms to other kinds of semantics; in particular, trace
--   semantics seems particularly interesting for investigating
--   whether our approach is suitable for formalizing and proving
--   important safety properties of non terminating programs, as
--   ensuring that a server will never try to use infinite resources.
--   Other approaches based on definitional interpreters [Danielsson
--   2012], and the adoption of step counters [Amin and Rompf 2017;
--   Ancona 2014; Ernst et al. 2006; Owens et al. 2016] seem to be
--   appealing for proving type soundness properties with big-step
--   semantics, and other results concerning program equivalence;
--   however, it is not clear whether these solutions work well for
--   other kinds of properties. For instance, if a program consists of
--   an infinite loop that allocates new heap space at each step
--   without releasing it, one would like to conclude that it will
--   eventually crash even though a definitional interpreter returns
--   timeout for all possible values of the step counter."
--
-- This is an attempt to show that definitional interpreters can
-- handle this situation.
